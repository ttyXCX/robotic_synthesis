# Neural Program Synthesis from Diverse Demonstration Videos

## Descriptions
This project is a TensorFlow implementation of [**Neural Program Synthesis from Diverse Demonstration Videos**](https://shaohua0116.github.io/demo2program/), which is published in ICML 2018. We provide codes and checkpoints for our model and all baselines presented in the paper. Also, we provide scripts and codes for generating datasets as well as the datasets we used to train and test all models.

As interpreting decision making logic in demonstration videos is key to collaborating with and mimicking humans, our goal is to empower machines with this ability. To this end, we propose a **neural program synthesizer** that is able to explicitly synthesize underlying programs from behaviorally diverse and visually complicated demonstration videos, as illustrated in the following figure.

</p>

We introduce a **summarizer module** as part of our model to improve the network’s ability to integrate multiple demonstrations varying in behavior. We also employ a **multi-task objective** to encourage the model to learn meaningful intermediate representations for end-to-end training. Our proposed model consists three components:
- **Demonstration Encoder** receives a demonstration video as input and produces an embedding that captures an agent’s actions and perception.
- **Summarizer Module** discovers and summarizes where actions diverge between demonstrations and upon which branching conditions subsequent actions are taken.
- **Program Decoder** represents the summarized understanding of demonstrations as a code sequence.

The illustration of the overall architecture is as follows. For more details, please refer to the paper.

Our method is evaluated on a fully observable, third-person environment (Karel environment) and a partially observable, egocentric game (ViZDoom environment). We show that our model is able to reliably synthesize underlying programs as well as capture diverse behaviors exhibited in demonstrations.

\*This code is still being developed and subject to change.

```

## Reproducing result on VizDoom dataset

Because the size of the demonstrations in VizDoom is usually very large, it is difficult to use large batch size and results in very slow training.
To circumvent this issue, we used two stage training; we pretrain our model with short demonstrations first and then finetune the model with the whole dataset.
For the first stage of the training, we used batch size: 32, and for the second stage of the training, we used batch size: 8.
Here are links to datasets that we used for the first and second stage of the training:
- First stage: [vizdoom_shorter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vDpKh_9ZhtJt5cglQ-Yw_dT6emdfGLB2)
- Second stage: [vizdoom_full](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1atiBwgNXc2oykMC7C6yeBduQ2efV13nN)

To reproduce our result, you can train and evaluate models with the following command:
- First stage: training for 50000 iterations
```bash
python trainer.py --model full --dataset_path path_to_vizdoom_shorter --dataset_type vizdoom --num_k 25 --batch_size 32
```
- Second stage: training for 50000 iterations
```bash
python trainer.py --model full --dataset_path path_to_vizdoom_full --dataset_type vizdoom --num_k 25 --batch_size 8 --checkpoint path_to_1st_step_checkpoint
```

For evaluation, use the following command:
```bash
python evaler.py --model full --dataset_path path_to_vizdoom_full --dataset_type vizdoom --num_k 25 --checkpoint path_to_2nd_step_checkpoint
```

## Results

### Karel environment

| Methods                        | Execution | Program | Sequence |
| ------------------------------ | :-------: | :-----: | :------: |
| Induction baseline             |   62.8%   |    -    |    -     |
| Synthesis baseline             |   64.1%   |  42.4%  |  35.7%   |
| + summarizer (ours)            |   68.6%   |  45.3%  |  38.3%   |
| +  multi-task loss (ours-full) |   72.1%   |  48.9%  |  41.0%   |

- Effect of the summarizer module

To verify the effectiveness of our proposed summarizer module, we conduct experiments where models are trained on varying numbers of demonstrations (k) and compare the execution accuracy.

| Methods             |  k=3  |  k=5  | k=10  |
| ------------------- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Synthesis baseline  | 58.5% | 60.1% | 64.1% |
| + summarizer (ours) | 60.6% | 63.1% | 68.6% |

### ViZDoom environment

| Methods            | Execution | Program | Sequence |
| ------------------ | :-------: | :-----: | :------: |
| Induction baseline |   35.1%   |    -    |    -     |
| Synthesis baseline |   48.2%   |  39.9%  |  33.1%   |
| Ours-full          |   78.4%   |  62.5%  |  53.2%   |

- If-else experiment: 

To verify the importance of inferring underlying conditions, we perform evaluation only with programs containing a single if-else statement with two branching consequences. This setting is sufficiently simple to isolate other diverse factors that might affect the evaluation result.

| Methods            | Execution | Program | Sequence |
| ------------------ | :-------: | :-----: | :------: |
| Induction baseline |   26.5%   |    -    |    -     |
| Synthesis baseline |   59.9%   |  44.4%  |  36.1%   |
| Ours-full          |   89.4%   |  69.1%  |  58.8%   |

- Generalization over different number of seen demonstrations

The baseline models and our model trained with 25 seen demonstration are evaluated with fewer or more seen demonstrations.
